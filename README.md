Dromosa
========

Dromosa is a game that tests your ability to quickly reorient yourself.

The objective is simple - There is a maze and you have to move through the maze to reach the goal. Step into fire and you start from the beginning.

But there's a catch - The Compass determines how your keyboard is oriented. When the Compass points North, your keyboard works as expected - Up is Up, Down is Down and so on. Step on the Compass Shifter and the Compass points to a random location. And this changes your keyboard orientation. For example, when the Compass points East, pressing Up takes you Right, pressing Right takes you down.
